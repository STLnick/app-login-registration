# Nick Ray README

## What I do

I'm a ~~restaurant General Manager~~ **Web Developer**. I focus on full-stack development using JavaScript.

## What I want to do

I'm working towards securing a full-time job in the Web Development field. I've _always_ enjoyed JavaScript and it's evolved so much in the time I've used it along with the frameworks and libraries that have spawned from it. It's become so **powerful** and **popular** that I'm excited to get into the field for real!

Eventually, after gaining some more real-world experience, I want to change over to mainly doing freelance work. I want to code. I also want more flexibility and freedom in my life that I've put to the side in an effort to get ahead by working multiple jobs or working and attending college full-time.
